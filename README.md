## Background
### Cyclistic
A bike-share company, named Cyclistic, is located in Chicago. This company launched in 2016, and has grown their fleet of bicycles over 5,800 bikes with over 650 stations throughout the city. They offer multiple bike options for those unable to use a standard two wheel such as reclining bikes and hand tricycles. Customers are able to rent bikes from one station and return the bikes to any other station once they are done riding. A trait that Cyclistic relies on to promote cycling as a way of transportation around the Chicago area.
The marketing strategy Cyclistic has used focused on creating awareness of their program and appealing to broad consumer segments. Part of this is flexible pricing plans for users that include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. The other part is offering bikes for all types of people including those who might have a hard time riding a standard two wheel bike. This is seen in the percentages of those who use their bikes to commute to work (30%) and users who opt for assistive bikes (8%).
Finance analysts at Cyclistic have learned that annual members produce more profit than casual riders. The marketing director believes that the key to future growth lies within turning casual riders to annual members. Insinuating that converting these users will be more beneficial than targeting completely new users.
A clear goal has been set to design marketing strategies that can help convert casual riders into annual members. This can be done by analyzing the difference between these types of riders and why someone would consider becoming an annual member. In order to do this, analysis of Cyclistic bike trip data will be done to identify trends and create insightful conclusions.
